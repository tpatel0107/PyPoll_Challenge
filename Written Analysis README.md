# Written Analysis of the Election Audit

**Overview of Election Audit: Purpose of the election audit is to 
	1) Provide the voter turnout for each county.
	2) Provide the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count. 
	3) Provide the county with the highest turnout. 

**Election-Audit Results
	*Total Votes cast were 369,711

**In summary election audit results provides an analysis of how votes were casted and where there was more voting due versus other counties where there was a low voting numbers. It also shows how some candidates faired much better than other candidates and in the end which candidate had the most votes based on final results. 
**Two ways this script can be formatted is 
	* We could add more counties so we could get more of an idea of the whole state. This would give us a bigger region, more data means we could get a better range of results. 
	* We could also add additional candidates so we could maybe have winners based on 1st, 2nd ,3rd and so onwards. This would provide us with a list of candidates that did better than others and break it down into sections.
